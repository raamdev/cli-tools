### Contributing (How-To)

#### Clone the `cli-tools` repo locally.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/websharks/cli-tools
$ cd cli-tools
$ git checkout 000000-dev
```

#### Build and satisfy all dependencies.

```bash
$ cd cli-tools
$ phing # This runs Composer too, automatically.
```

#### Add a new `scripts/[file.(php|bash|etc)]`

##### If your script has dependencies, add them to `composer.json`.

_Or, you can use a Homebrew package as a dependency; if that is easier._

_If you need configuration data, please obtain those values from `~/.websharks.json`. Your script should trigger an exception if configuration options are missing; i.e., you should alert the user instead of trying to fail gracefully._

#### Submit a Pull Request on GitHub

Submit a Pull Request so that your script can get merged into this repo. Raam/Jason will review.

 - In your PR, please be sure to include a list of any Homebrew packages that your script requires. Those will need to be added to our [Homebrew Formula for these CLI Tools](https://github.com/websharks/homebrew-formulas/blob/master/websharks-cli-tools.rb).

 - If your script requires configuration options; i.e., data from `~/.websharks.json`, please include the config. keys needed to use the script effectively. We will need to update the README file so it mentions that new configuration option.
