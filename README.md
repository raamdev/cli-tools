### Contributing (How-To)

```bash
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/websharks/cli-tools
$ git checkout 000000-dev
```

- Add a new `scripts/[file.(php|bash|etc)]`.

- If your script has dependencies, try to use a submodule.
  ```bash
  $ git submodule add [URL to Git repo] submodules/[package name]
  ```
  Or, you can use a Homebrew package as a dependency; if that is easier.

- If you need configuration data, please obtain those values from `~/.websharks.json`. Your script should trigger an exception if data is missing; i.e., you should alert the user instead of trying to fail gracefully.
  
- Submit a Pull Request so that your script can get merged into this repo. Raam/Jason will review.
 - In your PR, please be sure to include a list of any Homebrew packages that your script requires. Those will need to be added to our Homebrew Formula for these CLI Tools.
 - If your script requires configuration options; i.e., data from `~/.websharks.json`, please include the config. keys needed to use the script effectively. We will need to update the README file so it mentions that new configuration option.
